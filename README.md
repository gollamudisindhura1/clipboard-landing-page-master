# SBA - Clipboard Landing Page

# Overview

This project is part of my SBA for Design and Development. I built hte Clipboard Landing Page using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The goal was to take a design from Frontend Mentor and create it to look same while making it work on all screen sizes.

# Features

- Reusable Bootstrap components like cards, buttons, containers
- Hover effects on the buttons
- Simple footer with the social media icons
- Responsive Layout which works perfectly on any devices where used Grid and Flexbox.

# My Approach

I started by writing the HTML for the structure of the page. Then I used Bootstrap classes to style the layout and make it responsive. I added custom CSS for small things like buttons and the background color. I used bootstrap's grid system to align sections and make sure everything looks neat on mobile and desktop.

# Resources Used

- Google.com – to search for small issues and examples.
- https://getbootstrap.com – for layout, buttons, and responsiveness.
- https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9 – for the challenge and design reference.

# Challenges

- Bootstarp's fixed spacing was challenging when compared to the custm CSS where I could use any pixel value.
- Bootstrap had no built-in hover effects so buttons looked flat.
- Buttons stayed side by side on mobile screens instead of stacking vertically. I fixed this with d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row gap-3 which stacks them on phones and puts them side by side on desktop.

# What I Learned
- How to use Bootstrap for building faster layout
- How to connect styles using both Bootstrap and my own CSS together
- How to make a responsive webpage without writing a lot of custom CSS

# Reflection
- This project helped me understand how Bootstrap makes the web design easy.
- The improvements I have if have more time is I would work on spacing.
